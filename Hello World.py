# Hello World

print("This line will be printed.")

# Indentation
# Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces.
# Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces.
# For example:

x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")


# Exercise
# Use the "print" command to print the line "Hello, World!".

# print("Goodbye, World!")
print("Hello, World!")
